# Ethics Project
## As an organisation devised a “Hippocratic oath” for Data Practitioners & "A charter" for organisations using data for the Government of Genevia.
| 
Our organisation developed a comprehensive, principled, and forward-thinking framework designed to make Genovia a benchmark for ethical data and AI usage. There was a group presentation followed by a debate.
